                    <p>Thank you so much for coming to check out my work, and learning more about me! My name is Mackenzie Malone, and I am
                    the owner of Kenzerama Productions. I take pride in being one of the few female videographers and editors within the
                    industry.</p>
                    <p>I first began to set my sights on running my own videography business, shortly after holding my first camera. My great grandfather made his living as an air-brush artist, and my father is an internationally recognized advertising photographer. I think its safe to say it’s in my genes. I grew up in my fathers studio, where I would spend time watching him take test shots on a polaroid camera, and direct shoots for major corporations. Being on set fascinated me, and I quickly caught the bug.</p>
                    <p>I began Kenzerama Productions while I was in my third year of University, where I was studying Radio and Television Arts at Ryerson. While my primary major was documentary filmmaking, I always had a passion for the wedding industry. I landed my first job answering an ad on Kijiji, from a newly-engaged couple looking for a wedding videographer. At the time, Kijiji truly was the one stop shop for everything weddings. To this day, I still thank Crystal and Mike for taking a chance on me. I started out as a one-woman show, and now I have an amazing team of assistant shooters and editors, which has allowed my company to grow and expand into what it is today.</p>

                    <p> On the day of a wedding, I get invited in to the most intimate part of two families lives. I shoot the day as it happens, catching every smile, laugh, and tear. I capture the centerpieces your great aunt made table numbers 3 and 7 where your family will be sitting, and even the veil you are going to wear that their mother wore on her wedding day. I am a details person, and details are what tell your story.</p>
                    <p>When I am not spending my time behind the camera or in front of the computer editing, I can be found with my biggest fan, my dog Dexter. We are often roaming different neighborhoods around downtown Toronto, checking out the best dog parks, or taking weekend trips to my family cottage in the Kawartha’s. I will admit… he’s not much of a swimmer, but he does like to dip a paw in the lake when the temperature is just right.</p>
                    <p>I'm passionate about what I do, and that shows through the films that I produce. There is no better way to tell a love story, than two people on their wedding day. Want to know more about me? Just ask!</p>
