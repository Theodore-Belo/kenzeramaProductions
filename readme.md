A website I have built for a small business.

USES
- HTML5
- CSS/Sass
- jQuery
- PHP

The client did not want to rely on an online contact form service, so I used PHP to handle the form submission.
Validation for the contact form is done using jQuery.

The website is fully responsive, and is accessible except for the grey subheading under the business name.  I have advised the client that the contrast ratio is not adequate and may unfortunatly exclude some users from being able to properly read the content. They wished the color to remain the way it is for branding and overall look of the page.
